**COMPANY:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**INTERN NAME:** SATHYAPRIYA K  
**INTERN ID:** CT04DH2817  
**DOMAIN:** FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT  
**DURATION:** 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR:** NEELA SANTHOSH  

**Project Overview**  
The **E-Learning Platform UI** is a front-end interface for an online learning system built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. It includes a modern sign-up page, navigation bar, hero section, courses page, course detail pages with embedded videos, and a basic progress tracking feature for learners. The design emphasizes simplicity, responsiveness, and user engagement, ensuring a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

**Objectives**  
- Create a user-friendly and responsive interface for an e-learning platform.  
- Develop a sign-up form with essential input fields.  
- Build a navigation system for quick page access.  
- Implement a courses listing page with clickable course cards.  
- Add a course details page with video content and a “Mark as Complete” option.  
- Create a progress tracking system using local storage.

**Technologies Used**  
- **HTML5** – Structure of the web pages.  
- **CSS3** – Styling, layout design, and responsive behavior.  
- **JavaScript** – Dynamic content loading and progress tracking using local storage.

**Features**  
- Sign-up form with fields for full name, email, and password.  
- Navigation bar with styled buttons and hover effects.  
- Hero section with banner image and welcome text.  
- Courses page displaying HTML, JavaScript, and SQL courses.  
- Course details pages with embedded video players and descriptions.  
- “Mark as Complete” button that saves completion status to local storage.  
- Progress page showing Completed or Not Completed for lessons.  
- Responsive design for desktop and mobile screens.

**How It Works**  
1. Users access the sign-up page and create an account.  
2. The navigation bar provides links to Home, Courses, and Sign-Up pages.  
3. The courses page lists available lessons as interactive cards.  
4. Selecting a course opens the course details page with a video and description.  
5. Clicking “Mark as Complete” updates progress in local storage.  
6. The progress page displays each lesson’s completion status.

**Learning Outcomes**  
Through this project, I have:  
- Improved skills in building structured and styled web pages with HTML and CSS.  
- Learned to create visually appealing and responsive layouts.  
- Gained experience in JavaScript local storage for simple progress tracking.  
- Understood how to load content dynamically based on URL parameters.  
- Developed a better understanding of user navigation flow in web design.

**Future Enhancements**  
- Add user authentication and login functionality.  
- Implement detailed progress tracking with percentage completion.  
- Add quizzes and interactive learning activities.  
- Include downloadable resources for each course.  
- Integrate with a backend to securely store user data and progress.
