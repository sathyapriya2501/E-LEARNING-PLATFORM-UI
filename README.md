**COMPANY:** CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS  
**INTERN NAME:** SATHYAPRIYA K  
**INTERN ID:** CT04DH2817  
**DOMAIN:** FRONT-END DEVELOPMENT  
**DURATION:** 4 WEEKS  
**MENTOR:** NEELA SANTHOSH  

## Project Overview
The E-Learning Platform UI is a responsive front-end interface for an online learning system built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
It includes a clean sign-up form, navigation bar, hero section, course listing page, video-based course details pages, and a progress tracking system using browser localStorage.
The design focuses on simplicity, user-friendliness, and compatibility across devices, enabling learners to easily explore courses, watch lessons, and track their progress.

## Objectives
- Create a user-friendly sign-up page for new learners.  
- Develop a navigation bar for smooth page transitions.  
- Design a Courses page listing available learning modules.  
- Implement Course Details pages with embedded videos and a “Mark as Complete” feature.  
- Build a Progress page showing lesson completion status.  
- Maintain a clean, responsive design for desktop and mobile.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5 – Page structure and content  
- CSS3 – Styling, layouts, hover effects, responsiveness  
- JavaScript (ES6) – Dynamic content loading and progress tracking using localStorage

## Features
- Sign-Up Form with fields for Name, Email, and Password  
- Navigation Bar with hover effects for better user interaction  
- Hero Section with a banner image and introductory text  
- Courses Page displaying:
  - HTML Basics
  - JavaScript Essentials
  - SQL Database  
- Course Details Page with:
  - Lesson title and description
  - Embedded video player
  - "Mark as Complete" button storing data in localStorage  
- Progress Page showing either Completed or Not Completed status for lessons  
- Fully responsive layout adapting to different screen sizes

## How It Works
1. Users sign up by filling the form in `login.html`.  
2. The navigation bar links to Home, Courses, and Sign-Up pages.  
3. The Courses page (`courses.html`) lists all available courses.  
4. Clicking a course opens `course-details.html` with content loaded via URL parameters.  
5. The “Mark as Complete” button saves completion status to localStorage.  
6. The Progress page (`progress.html`) reads stored data and displays the lesson status.

## Learning Outcomes
- Enhanced skills in HTML and CSS for structured, responsive web design.  
- Learned to use JavaScript localStorage for saving user progress.  
- Understood URL parameter handling for dynamic page content.  
- Improved ability to create intuitive and visually appealing interfaces.

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication and login system.  
- Add percentage-based progress tracking with progress bars.  
- Include interactive quizzes and downloadable resources.  
- Connect to a backend for secure user data and course management.
